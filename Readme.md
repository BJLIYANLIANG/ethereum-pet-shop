#### Compilation
Open a new console window and run the command `testrpc`. This starts a new, local blockchain instance powered by EthereumJS TestRPC. Once the TestRPC boots up, you'll see a list of available accounts and private keys, and a section called HD Wallet.

Back in your first console window, run the command:

`truffle compile` or `truffle test`

#### Development

To run ui run `npm run dev` and open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
